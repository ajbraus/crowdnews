I am a journalist with story, and I have 300 backers who give me on average $200 an article I write. I like to write once every two weeks for extra income. I can visit my profile page and make edits to my profile and track the success of my recent posts. I've been trying different ways to improve my traffic. 50 of my backers are 'share backers' so when I post I always get about 300 impressions. 

Today I want to make a new post. I login, go to my profile and from there I can see posts I've published and those that aren't published yet. I select "New Story" and write a title, and an image I think I have the rights to, on second thought I remove the picture. I actually want to add a gallery of images.
